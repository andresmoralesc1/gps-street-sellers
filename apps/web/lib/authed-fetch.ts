/**
 * Auth-aware fetch wrapper (Sprint 7 B-AUTH-2).
 *
 * Why this exists:
 *   - The access token cookie expires after 15 minutes.
 *   - The refresh-token cookie lasts 7 days and is sent to /api/auth/refresh
 *     to mint a new access token. Both cookies are httpOnly + SameSite=strict
 *     so the browser sends them on every same-origin POST automatically.
 *   - Before Sprint 7, no client code called /api/auth/refresh. After 15 min
 *     of idle, every authenticated fetch returned 401 and the user had to
 *     log in again — a constant source of complaints.
 *
 * What this does:
 *   - Wraps every `fetch()` that goes through `authedFetch()`.
 *   - If the response is 401 (token expired OR refresh-token expired),
 *     tries one silent refresh, retries the original request once.
 *   - If the refresh itself fails, clears the user state and redirects to
 *     /login so the user can re-authenticate. We don't throw — the caller
 *     will get whatever the retry returned (401 or 200), and pages that
 *     care about auth state re-read it from the store.
 *
 * Why not a service worker or middleware interceptor?
 *   - Next.js Edge middleware can't read httpOnly cookies from a server-side
 *     fetch (the cookie is opaque to JS). It can only redirect. The actual
 *     refresh round-trip has to happen from client code.
 *
 * Pitfalls:
 *   - We MUST NOT call /api/auth/refresh on a request that itself was the
 *     refresh attempt (would infinite-loop). The `retried` flag prevents that.
 *   - On mobile a flaky network can cause a 401 even when the cookie is
 *     valid (e.g. race with another tab's logout). We retry the request
 *     after refresh but if the refresh also fails, we give up cleanly — never
 *     bounce the user to /login mid-task on a one-off transient error.

 * The wrapper is intentionally narrow: it only fires on 401 with the

 * endpoint that returns a body error is still surfaced to the caller —
 * we don't want to mask real auth errors as "just an expired token".
