/**
 * PM2 ecosystem file for GPS Street Sellers.
 *
 * Why this file exists:
 * - Next.js doesn't auto-load .env.local at PM2 start unless you point PM2 at it
 *   explicitly via `env_file`. Without that, env precedence puts .env.local on top
 *   at runtime but the shell-launched process never sees it.
 * - The previous "just npm start" approach broke whenever someone needed to change
 *   env (had to pm2 kill the whole daemon, which was scary with other services).
 *   This file makes restarts surgical: `pm2 reload gps` is enough.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pm2 start ecosystem.config.js             # first-time start
 *   pm2 reload gps                            # after code changes (zero-downtime)
 *   pm2 restart gps                           # hard restart (faster than reload)
 *   pm2 logs gps                              # tail logs
 *   pm2 save                                  # persist current process list across reboots
 *   pm2 resurrect                             # restore on server boot (after `pm2 save`)
 *
 * Safe: only this app is managed. n8n, twenty, minio, postgres, redis, caddy
 * are all separate (systemd / docker / standalone) and are NOT touched.
