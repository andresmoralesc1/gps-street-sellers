/**
 * CSRF defense via Origin / Referer header check (S3-SEC-4).
 *
 * Browsers automatically include `Origin` on cross-origin POST/PATCH/DELETE
 * requests (and `Referer` as a fallback when Origin is missing, e.g. in some
 * Same-Origin POSTs). For state-mutating endpoints we verify the Origin
 * matches the configured app origin. This blocks classic CSRF attacks where
 * a malicious site submits a hidden form or fetch to our API on behalf of a
 * logged-in user.
 *
 * This is defense in depth on top of:
 *   1. `SameSite=strict` on auth cookies (S3-SEC-3) — modern browsers drop
 *      cookies on cross-site requests entirely. Older browsers and some
 *      iframe-included requests still leak cookies.
 *   2. The cookies themselves are `httpOnly` and our auth model is bearer-
 *      token in cookie (not Authorization header), so the tokens are sent.
 *
 * Why not a CSRF token? Inertia + Next.js means every React state-mutating
 * call is a fetch from the same JavaScript context — generating a per-tab
 * token would require reading it from a cookie on every render. The Origin
 * check is simpler, equally effective for state-mutating endpoints, and
 * doesn't break idempotency (GET requests are unaffected).
 *
 * Operating modes (`CSRF_ALLOW_MISSING_ORIGIN`):
 *   - unset / "0" (default for production): require Origin OR Referer
 *     matching getAppOrigin(). Reject cross-origin and missing-origin.
 *   - "1" (set in .env.test): allow missing-origin, but still reject
 *     cross-origin. Use this only in test/CI environments.
 *
 * Edge cases:
 *   - For `unsafe` methods (GET/HEAD/OPTIONS) the function returns null.
 *   - For methods that need the body (POST/PUT/PATCH) we short-circuit
 *     BEFORE reading the body — attackers can't waste CPU.
